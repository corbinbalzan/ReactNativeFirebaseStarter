### Getting Started

#### 1) Clone & Install Dependencies

#### 4) Add `Google Services` files (plist & JSON)

- 4.1) **[iOS]** Follow the `add firebase to your app` instructions [here](https://firebase.google.com/docs/ios/setup#add_firebase_to_your_app) to generate your `GoogleService-Info.plist` file if you haven't done so already - use the package name generated previously as your `iOS bundle ID`.
- 4.2) **[iOS]** Place this file in the `ios/` directory of your project.
  - Once added to the directory, add the file to your Xcode project using 'File > Add Files to "[YOUR APP NAME]"â€¦' and selecting the plist file.
- 4.3) **[Android]** Follow the `manually add firebase` to your app instructions [here](https://firebase.google.com/docs/android/setup#manually_add_firebase) to generate your `google-services.json` file if you haven't done so already - use the package name generated previously as your `Android package name`.
- 4.4) **[Android]** Place this file in the `android/app/` directory of your project.
